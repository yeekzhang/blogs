Summary: Historically, search engines have been unable to extract content, such as text and links, from Flash (SWF) files. Subsequently, much of the Flash-based content on the web has been unavailable in search results. This situation has been frustrating for web developers, who have tried to come up with workarounds to help get search engines to index and rank their Flash pages.

This situation hasn’t been ideal for searchers either, as this limitation has kept them from seeing potentially great matches for their queries because they’ve been locked away in Flash files.

According to Adobe and Google, all of that is changing. Google is launching what they tell me is a “deep algorithmic change,” augmented by Flash reader technology supplied by Adobe, that enables them to “read” Flash files and extract text and links from it for better indexing and ranking. This could be great news for both site owners and searchers.

Below, more details about how it all works, as well as some caveats for those who see this development as a Flash panacea and think they no longer have to ensure their Flash applications are search engine friendly.

# Google can now crawl and index Flash files
Google has been working on improving how they crawl and index rich content (such as Flash and JavaScript) for some time, and in fact have been able to extract some text and links from Flash files for a while. However, their methods weren’t perfect, and they tell me that this new technology from Adobe makes Google’s algorithms “less error prone” and enables them to access content created in any version of Flash in a variety of languages.

# Adobe is providing a Flash player to (some) search engines
Adobe says they have developed an optimized Flash player for search engines and are collaborating with both Google and Yahoo!. Yahoo! has not yet implemented the technology, although they stated that “Yahoo! is committed to supporting webmaster needs with plans to support searchable SWF and is working with Adobe to determine the best possible implementation.” Adobe hasn’t made the technology available to Microsoft’s Live Search, although they say they are “exploring ways to make the technology more broadly available” to “help make all SWF content more easily searchable.” Adobe didn’t comment on whether the fact that Microsoft developing competing Silverlight was a factor in their decision not to collaborate with Microsoft Live Search for this initial announcement.
