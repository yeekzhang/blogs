[Toxy](https://toxy.codeplex.com/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/tonyqus/toxy/tree/master/ToxyFramework)
```
Toxy is a .NET data/text extraction framework similar to Apache Tika in Java. It supports a lot of popular formats such as docx, xlsx, xls, pdf, csv, txt, epub, html and so on.
```

[Tika](http://tika.apache.org/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/tika) OR [SVN](http://svn.apache.org/)
```
The Apache Tika™ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and much more. You can find the latest release on the download page. Please see the Getting Started page for more information on how to start using Tika.

The Parser and Detector pages describe the main interfaces of Tika and how they work.

[Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr) OR [Reposity](http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/)
```
Solr is highly reliable, scalable and fault tolerant, providing distributed indexing, replication and load-balanced querying, automated failover and recovery, centralized configuration and more. Solr powers the search and navigation features of many of the world's largest internet sites.
```

[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) - [GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)
```
Elasticsearch is a distributed RESTful search engine built for the cloud. Features include:
    1. Distributed and Highly Available Search Engine.
        Each index is fully sharded with a configurable number of shards.
        Each shard can have one or more replicas.
        Read / Search operations performed on any of the replica shards.
    2. Multi Tenant with Multi Types.
        Support for more than one index.
        Support for more than one type per index.
        Index level configuration (number of shards, index storage, …).
    3. Various set of APIs
        HTTP RESTful API
        Native Java API.
        All APIs perform automatic node operation rerouting.
    4. Document oriented
        No need for upfront schema definition.
        Schema can be defined per type for customization of the indexing process.
    5. Reliable, Asynchronous Write Behind for long term persistency.
    6. (Near) Real Time Search.
    7. Built on top of Lucene
        Each shard is a fully functional Lucene index
        All the power of Lucene easily exposed through simple configuration / plugins.
    8. Per operation consistency
        Single document level operations are atomic, consistent, isolated and durable.
    9. Open Source under the Apache License, version 2 (“ALv2”)

[Nutch](http://nutch.apache.org/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/nutch)
```
Being pluggable and modular of course has it's benefits, Nutch provides extensible interfaces such as Parse, Index and ScoringFilter's for custom implementations e.g. Apache Tika™ for parsing. Additonally, pluggable indexing exists for Apache Solr™, Elastic Search, SolrCloud, etc.
